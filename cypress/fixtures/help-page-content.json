        "The UKMCAB service is the definitive source and a register of UK Government appointed Conformity Assessment Bodies (CABs) who can certify goods for both the Great Britain and Northern Ireland markets.",
        "As the UK exited the EU, an alternative to the previously used NANDO system was required. NANDO is the EU service that provides the same functionality across all member countries and organisations.",
        "In March 2019, a UK version of NANDO was created, on GOV.UK, however it lacked functionality, specifically around the process for CAB creation and approvals from the various organisations and departments involved. These requirements, and others, are intended to be delivered with the bespoke developed UKMCAB service.",

        "UKMCAB is currently in the Public Beta phase. This is where a web site or a service is continually developed to an agreed set of requirements and is delivered in shorter phases of multiple releases. This ensures that the service is always developing, unlike many traditional technology projects where updates can take months and years to reach the user. The service is tested and improved with the help of users who offer feedback or agree to participate in user research. Both of which can influence how the future service is changed.",
        "The Public Beta is the minimum viable product. It is what is required from the site to meet the basic needs of the business owners and the users. In the case of the UKMCAB service the Public Beta is to replace the existing interim site with the same level of functionality.",
        "From the Public Beta the project will continuously release updates through a series of phases which will deliver larger areas of functionality, such as approvals processes."
